# DNA Problem::


- A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.
- An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."
- Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.
-  Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.

## Sample Dataset:: 
### AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC

## Sample Output
-  a = 20 c = 12 g = 17 t = 21


## The Challenge

- You will need to implement the counters as per the name in names in the return statement.
- You will then need to create a loop to parse each Char within the string and count them
-  By passing the values to counters.
